## Quarto

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.
To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy))
p + geom_boxplot()

```
