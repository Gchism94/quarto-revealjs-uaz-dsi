## Quarto

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.
To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Blockquotes

> Women belong in all places where decisions are being made.
> It shouldn't be that women are the exception.

\- Ruth Bader Ginsburg

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) + geom_line()
m <- lm(hwy ~ class, data = mpg)
```

Here's a formatted but unevaluated code block

``` python

print("Hello!")
```

## Code with output

output is by default below code

```{r}
#| echo: true
print("Hello")
```

But can also be on the side

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cyl)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Tabset slide

::: panel-tabset
## Tab1

There is some text in this tab.

## Tab2

```{r}
plot(iris)
```

## Equations

Here are some equations:

$$
y = \alpha_i + \beta_1x_1
$$

This is an inline equation $e = MC^2$
